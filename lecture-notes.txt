- much of the knowledge in an intelligent system needs to be represented explicitly. why? not sure yet but apparently he said at some other point


- figuring out the domain of a given problem is actually one of the hardest things to do with a project.  It is easy to make it too simple or to consider too much and make it particulary complicated.

PROBLEMS IN KB AI:
1 possible "in principle" limitations
5. how can someone interact "naturally" with kb systems?
6. how can you combine several enterers knowledge?
7. how can builder and user not get lost?

key questions for kb ai
knowledge representations
- what forms can they take
-what are the ramifications of different forms?
-what are the issues and problems for KR

rule based systems fit into the bigger picture of knowledge based systems


rule based systems
knowledge representations:
- primary knowledge form: if the rules, facts, hierarchies
-primary knowledge content: deep knowledge about narrow domains

knowledge acquisition/refinement
- primary acquisition: knowledge engineer interacts with domain expert

knowledge access and utilization
- heuristic search through rules
- matching facts in a database


architecture:

user <-> expert system shell <-> inference engine <- rule base
			   \<-> working memory


when theyre useful
- for problems hard to solve conventionally (due to lack of good algorithms or computational cost)
- problems for which knowledge plays bigger role




if you have multiple rules that apply, how do you pick the rule to follow/take action on
- could try each and pick the one that works best over time and stick with that
- could choose the rule that contains the most information content for the given problem
- can actually encode a reasoner that takes action based on expertise
- rule ordering
- context limiting (organize rules in groups active at different times)
- specificity/size
- data ordering (driven by the data/ by new information)
- recency ordering (least recently used)
- meta-rules
- preference analyzer


ordering of rules in rule based systems is dynamically determined




these systems are very good for things like classification and diganosing conditions, but
how can change these systems to generate things more creatively (art)?
